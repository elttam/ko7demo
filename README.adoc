A docker-contained https://github.com/koseven/koseven[koseven] hello world to play with CVE-2019-8979, a SQL injection vulnerability affecting versions < 3.3.10.
This hello world actually comes from the https://koseven.dev/documentation/orm/examples/simple[documentation], I just added the Docker parts and the PoC exploit.

= CVE-2019-8979
This SQL injection issue was originally reported by a third party and fixed on https://github.com/koseven/koseven/issues/323[27 Feb 2019] in master but a new release containing the fix was subsequently published.
As a result the latest stable release at the time https://github.com/koseven/koseven/releases/tag/3.3.9[koseven-3.3.9], published on 20 Nov 2018, remained vulnerable until https://github.com/koseven/koseven/releases/tag/3.3.10[koseven-3.3.10] was released on 12 Oct 2020, after https://elttam.com[elttam] noticed and privately disclosed the oversight to the core developers on 10 Oct 2020.

= Limitations

Although some information can be obtained from MySQL such as `current_user()`, `database()` and column and table names from `information_schema`, it may not be possible to retrieve data from other tables due to `strtoupper()` being https://github.com/koseven/koseven/blob/3.3.9/modules/database/classes/Kohana/Database/Query/Builder.php#L236[called] on the `order by` direction input.

This is because database and table names are case sensitive when MySQL is running on an operating sytem where the data directory resides on a case sensitive filesystem.
As a result this SQLi may only be fully exploitable if:

- the filesystem is not case sensitive such as in Windows or macOS/HFS+
- the `lower_case_table_names` sysvar is `> 0`
- the target database and table name and column names are already all uppercase (unlikely)

See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html[Identifier Case Sensitivity] for more info.
